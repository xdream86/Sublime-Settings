Projects can now coexist peacefully with bookmarks :) 

Next time you use sublimeBookmarks, it will only show bookmarks belonging to the project
you were working on.

Also, the bookmarks will be *wiped one _last_ time*. I'm really sorry about this.

If you had created bookmarks without a project, then these bookmarks will always be shown.
These settings can be changed by going to _Preferences->Package Settings->sublimeBookmarks->Settings (Default)_,copy-pasting the settings to _Preferences->Package Settings->sublimeBookmarks->Settings (User)_ and then changing them.

Have fun, and as usual, report all bugs to [github](https://github.com/bollu/sublimeBookmark/issues?state=open).

Thanks for using the plugin :)
