Thanks for installing *SublimeBookmarks*. I hope this plugin helps you :)

To Use
======

Visit the github page for a quick intro. [https://github.com/bollu/sublimeBookmark]

Press Ctrl+P (or) Cmd+P depending on your OS.
Use _Add Bookmark_ to add a bookmark.
Use _Goto Bookmark_ to goto a bookmark
Use _Remove Bookmark_ to remove a bookmark
Use _Remove All Bookmarks_ to clear the list of bookmarks

There are three modes to the plugin:
1) All bookmarks will be shown all the time - bookmarks will not be filtered based on the current project. For this mode, use the __Show All Bookmarks__ option.

2)Only bookmarks of the current project will be shown - bookmarks belonging to other projects are *NOT* shown in this mode. Use the Use the __Show Bookmarks In Current Project__ for this mode.

3) Only bookmarks in the current file is shown - irrespective of project. Use the __Show Bookmarks In Current File__ option for this mode.

I hope you enjoy using the plugin as much as I enjoyed writing it :)
