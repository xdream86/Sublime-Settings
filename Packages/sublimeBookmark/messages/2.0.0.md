Sorry everybody, I've had a lot of college stuff to do and I haven't been able to work on
this for a long time.

However, I've taken the time to learn python and rewrite this from scratch. the codebase is sane, the features work, and most importantly - no more weirdness :)

I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused with the first two iterations - But I'm a newbie at python. This is not an excuse, I know, but is hopefully some form of apology.

Please enjoy using the plugin, and as usual - contact me if you have any bugs / enhancements
to [github](https://github.com/bollu/sublimeBookmark/issues?state=open).

Thanks again!
